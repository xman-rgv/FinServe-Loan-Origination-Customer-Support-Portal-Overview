FinServe – Loan Origination & Customer 
Support Portal 
Overview 
Our project focuses on transforming the loan management process in the banking and 
financial sector. Traditional loan processing is slow, paper-heavy, and error-prone — 
leading to delays, poor customer experience, and revenue loss. 
FinServe is a Salesforce-based solution designed to digitize and automate loan origination, 
approval workflows, KYC verification, EMI reminders, and customer support, while 
providing real-time dashboards for management. 
What Makes Our Project Special 
Most existing systems only track applications or send reminders. FinServe goes further by: 
✔ Automating end-to-end loan origination (application to disbursement). 
✔ Providing multi-stage approval workflows with built-in compliance checks. 
✔ Integrating with external KYC/credit scoring systems for faster verification. 
✔ Offering automated EMI reminders and overdue escalations. 
✔ Delivering real-time dashboards for loan performance and agent activity. 
✔ Ensuring a seamless experience for customers, loan officers, and managers. 
Technologies We Are Using 
Platform – Salesforce CRM 
• Standard & Custom Objects for Loans, Applications, Customers. 
• Process Automation with Flows, Approvals, and Apex. 
• Lightning Web Components (LWC) for customer portals. 
Integration 
• External APIs for KYC and credit score checks. 
• SMS/Email services for EMI reminders and customer updates. 
Data Tools

Architectural Flow 
1. Input Layer (Loan Application Intake) 
• Customer submits loan application via web form/portal. 
• Salesforce auto-creates a Lead/Application record. 
2. Processing Layer 
• Approval workflows route applications to Loan Officers → RMs → Credit 
Managers. 
• KYC Verification integrates with external APIs. 
• Salesforce automation tracks required documents and status. 
3. Loan Management Layer 
• Once approved, Opportunity is converted to Loan Record. 
• EMI schedules generated and reminders automated. 
4. Customer Support Layer 
• Customers receive updates via SMS/Email. 
• Cases created automatically for overdue EMIs or service requests. 
5. Analytics Layer (Dashboards & Reports) 
• Tracks loan volumes, approval timelines, default rates. 
• Monitors agent performance and customer satisfaction. 
How This Solves the Challenge 
• ✔ Faster Processing – Automates approvals, reducing loan turnaround time. 
• ✔ Transparency – Customers receive real-time updates on application status. 
• ✔ Compliance & Security – Integrated KYC/credit checks ensure regulatory compliance. 
• ✔ Customer Retention – Timely EMI reminders and proactive support improve trust. 
• ✔ Management Insights – Dashboards enable data-driven decisions on loan policies. 
Long-Term Vision 
The vision of FinServe is to build a fully digital Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) layer on 
Salesforce that can be scaled to multiple financial products — from personal loans and credit 
cards to mortgages and corporate financing. By integrating AI for risk scoring and predictive 
analytics, FinServe can become a next-gen intelligent financial CRM platform.

• ✔ Real-time dashboards that track both customer activity and internal 
performance.
